\arguments{
\item{shape}{A sf object with LINESTRING geometries, or a sfnetwork}

\item{georedds}{An optional dataframe with coordinates for each redd observation}

\item{georedds.type}{An optional name for the column with classification of redds}

\item{georedds.coords}{A character vector with the column names for lon/lat in georedds}

\item{reddcrs}{A crs for the coordinates in georedds}

\item{tolerance.redds}{A maximum distance for snapping redds to the shape}

\item{tolerance.surveys}{A maximum distance for snapping surveys to the shape (should be small)}

\item{surveys}{A sf object with LINESTRINGs representing surveys}

\item{survey.redds}{optional name of a column with survey counts}
}
\value{
a dataframe with dates, counts, and effort for each surveyed location
}
\description{
This function takes an sfnetwork or sf shape, a set of surveys, and optionally a set of
georeferenced redds observations, and returns a data set with the effort assigned to each reach
and the count types associated with that observation date.
